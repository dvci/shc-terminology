**Implementation note:** In a SMART Health Card, values of the `vc.type` element SHALL be in the format `https://smarthealth.cards#$SOME_CODE`, where `$SOME_CODE` is replaced by one of the codes listed below.

For example, all SMART Health Cards have the value `https://smarthealth.cards#health-card` in `vc.type` array. Additional values may also be included in this array. For more information, please see the [SMART Health Card specification](https://spec.smarthealth.cards/#health-cards-are-encoded-as-compact-serialization-json-web-signatures-jws).
