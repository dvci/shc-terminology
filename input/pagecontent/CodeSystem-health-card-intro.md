### Usage

The codes in this code system are used to identify a Health Card's type.

As described in the [SMART Health Card specification](https://spec.smarthealth.cards/#health-cards-are-encoded-as-compact-serialization-json-web-signatures-jws), all SMART Health Cards have a type of `https://smarthealth.cards#health-card`.

Additionally, SMART Health Cards may also be annotated with additional, more granular types, such as `https://smarthealth.cards#covid19`.
