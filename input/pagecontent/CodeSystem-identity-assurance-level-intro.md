### Usage

This code system defines levels of identity assurance, based on [NIST 800-63-3](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html#52--assurance-levels).

These codes may be used by Issuers of SMART Health Cards to record if/how a patient's identity was verified at the point of care. For example, if a patient showed their driver's license to verify their name and date of birth when getting a vaccination, this would correspond to `IAL1.4`.
